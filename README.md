# txt
a text based game framework, sorta like [cel7](https://rxi.itch.io/cel7) but not quite. it uses [Wren](https://wren.io/), the font is unchangeable and I didn't want to design a palette so you can use rgb (0-255)

## how to use

download latest txt version from releases

run `txt` in the command line, pass a file name to run from that

tada.wav

[documentation](/api.md)
