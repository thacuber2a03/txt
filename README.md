# txt
a text based game framework, sorta like [cel7](https://rxi.itch.io/cel7) but not quite. it uses [Wren](https://wren.io/), the font is unchangeable and I didn't want to design a palette so you can use rgb (0-255)

## how to use

download latest txt version from releases

make a `main.wren` file, then paste this small hello world in

```wren
import "txt" for TXT

class Game {
	construct new() {
		TXT.size(16, 16)
	}

	update(dt) {
		TXT.color(100)
		TXT.clear(".")
		var msg = "Hello world!"
		TXT.color(255)
		TXT.write(TXT.width()/2-msg.count/2, TXT.height()/2, msg)
	}
}
```

if you cloned from this repo, the `main.wren` file should already be there

save and close the file, then run `txt` in the command line

## doc

you must make a 'Game' class with a `new` constructor and an `update` method that must also take in a parameter for the delta time

all of txt's behavior is within the `TXT` foreign class, and currently all "get" methods have an actual Wren getter attached

### window methods

note: all window position/size related methods are measured in cells

| method | description |
| :-: | :-: |
| `width()`     | returns window width                             |
| `width(w)`    | sets window width to `w`                         |
| `height()`    | returns window height                            |
| `height(h)`   | sets window height to `h`                        |
| `size()`      | returns window size as a list                    |
| `size(w,h)`   | compressed version of `width(w)` and `height(h)` |
| `size(s)`     | sets window size to `s`, s must be a list        |
| `title(t)`    | sets window title to `t`                         |
| `move(x,y)`   | moves window by `x`, `y`                         |
| `fontSize(s)` | sets font size to `s`                            |
| `exit()`      | exits txt                                        |

### drawing methods

| method | description |
| :-: | :-: |
| `clear(char)`        | clears screen with character `char`                      |
| `write(x,y,text)`    | writes `text` at position `x`, `y`                       |
| `read(x,y)`          | reads character at position `x`, `y`                     |
| `color(r,g,b)`       | sets color for new characters to `r`, `g`, `b`           |
| `color(g)`           | grayscale version of `color(r,g,b)`                      |
| `bgColor(r,g,b)`     | same as `color(r,g,b)` but sets background color instead |
| `bgColor(g)`         | grayscale version of `bgColor(r,g,b)`                    |

note: both the current color and current background color will reset after the end of the `update` method

### input methods

| method | description |
| :-: | :-: |
| `mousePos()`         | returns mouse position in cell coordinates as list       |
| `mouseDown(btn)`     | checks if mouse button `btn` is down                     |
| `mousePressed(btn)`  | checks if mouse button `btn` was just pressed            |
| `keyDown(key)`       | checks if keyboard key `key` is down                     |
| `keyPressed(key)`    | checks if keyboard key `key` was just pressed            |
| `charPressed()`      | returns character just pressed. (can be utf-8)           |
