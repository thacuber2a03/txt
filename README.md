# txt
a text based game framework, sorta like [cel7](https://rxi.itch.io/cel7) but not quite. it uses [Wren](https://wren.io/), the font is unchangeable and I didn't want to design a palette so you can use rgb (0-255)

## how to use

download latest txt version from releases

run `txt` in the command line, pass a file name to run from that

tada.wav

## games made with it

a little game of shifting letters to make words

## doc

you must make a 'Game' class with a `new` constructor and an `update` method that must also take in a parameter for the delta time

all of txt's behavior is within the `TXT` foreign class.

### window methods

note: all window position/size related methods are measured in cells

| method | description |
| :-: | :-: |
| `width`        | returns window width                                  |
| `width=(w)`    | sets window width to `w`                              |
| `height`       | returns window height                                 |
| `height=(h)`   | sets window height to `h`                             |
| `size`         | returns window size as a list                         |
| `size(w,h)`    | shorter version of calling `width(w)` and `height(h)` |
| `size(s)`      | sets window size to `s`, s must be a list             |

| `move(x,y)`    | moves window by `x`, `y`                              |
| `move(p)`      | shorter version of `move(x, y)`, takes a list         |
| `fontSize(px)` | sets font size to `px`                                |
| `exit()`       | exits txt                                             |
